# 🚗 Car Data Analysis Project (Excel)
## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis and business insights derived from an automobile dataset using Microsoft Excel. The objective is to analyze car specifications, mileage, safety features, and dimensions to support data-driven decision-making in the automotive domain.
The project is structured into multiple analytical tasks, each addressing a specific business question using Excel formulas, filtering, aggregation, and logical analysis.
# 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains detailed information about various car models, including:
- Make & Model
- City & Highway Mileage (km/l)
- Engine Displacement
- Body Type
- Fuel Tank Capacity
- Car Dimensions (Height, Length, Width)
- Power
- Ground Clearance
- Safety Features (Airbags, Traction Control)
# 🎯 Project Objectives
